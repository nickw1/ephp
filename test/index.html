<h1>EPHP Tester</h1>
<p>This will test the EPHP websocket server by firing a certain number of
simultaneous requests at it. It assumes a table called 'songs' containing
music data, and a 'basicsearch.php' script in each home 
directory to search for a given artist (provided here). The chosen artists are 
the artists with the most UK number ones (so that many results appear). Feel 
free to create your own database and modify the artist list, or even use 
something unrelated to music.</p>
